# FarooqHamidInverse

This is a matrix inverse algorithm based on Ahmad Farooq and Khan Hamid of King Khalid University 2010 paper titled An efficient and simple algorithm for Matrix Inversion. 

The algorithm by itself has a time complexity of O(n^3). However it is easy to implement and is faster than Gauss-Jordan elimination for matrices of size less than 500x500. 

Another advantage of this algorithm is that it is capable of finding pseudo-inverse of non-square matrices.
